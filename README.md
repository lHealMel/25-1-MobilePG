# Code

[Flask Api](https://github.com/lHealMel/25-1-MobilePG/tree/main/API) : API of app, using FLASK of python.

API Folder(File) is not an element of Android app.

It is easy to upload and manage, but must be executed separately in actual execution. (run.py)




# Notice
Spotify & API Key is managed by the '.env' file in the API folder.

However, The .env file is private.
